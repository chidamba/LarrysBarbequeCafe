This is an android application being developed for Larry J's Barbeque Cafe located in Boston, Massachusetts. It is meant to enable customers to place an order using this android application.

This application is compatible with Android API versions 16 and above. It also implements Paypal's REST APIs for Payment Gateway Integration.

There are a few bugs in this application and hence might not be very useful in placing an order. A fully functional version will be uploaded soon.

This application was developed out of my own interest. The application is also avaialble for download in the Google Play Store under the name "Larry J's Barbeque Cafe".
